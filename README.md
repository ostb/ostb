Open Source Textbooks
=========

See it here: http://textbooks.io/

OSTB is a platform for anyone, especially professors and teachers, to write powerful, interactive textbooks to share with the world. Our platform relies on shareJS for real-time collaboration, stackedit for our base markdown editor, and node for our backend. 

OSTB will allow users to download and deploy their pages/books to their own hosting/servers. To allow for the creation of interactive components, we integrate jQuery, D3, C3, and Tangle (others may be added).
